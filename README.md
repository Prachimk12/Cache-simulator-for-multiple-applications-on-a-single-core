# Cache-simulator-for-multiple-applications-on-a-single-core
The project gives an analysis based on the results of comparing applications running on a single core using First Come First Served (FCFS) and Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithms. The cache mapping functionality used are Direct cache mapping and Fully Associative cache mapping. The cache replacement policy used for these analysis is First In First Out (FIFO) as it gives the least effective performance compared to LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy, analyzing the simulator for worst condition possible. The performance is also analyzed by varying the block size.
